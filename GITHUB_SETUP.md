## GitHub Issue Templates ‚úÖ

Issue templates have been created to standardize issue creation:

### Templates Available:
- **üéØ Epic Template** - For major feature development
- **‚ö° Feature/Task Template** - For specific development tasks
- **üêõ Bug Report Template** - For reporting bugs and issues
- **üöÄ Performance Template** - For performance issues and optimizations
- **üìö Documentation Template** - For documentation requests

### Key Features:

## GitHub Projects Setup Steps

1. **Create GitHub Repository**
   - Initialize repository with README
   - Add .gitignore and LICENSE
   - Set up branch protection rules

2. **Create GitHub Project Board**
   - Create new project (beta/v2)
   - Set up columns: Backlog, Ready, In Progress, Code Review, Testing, Done
   - Configure automation rules

3. **Create Epic Issues**
   - Create one issue for each Epic above
   - Use "Epic" or "enhancement" labels
   - Add detailed descriptions and acceptance criteria

4. **Break Down First Epic**
   - Create individual task issues for Epic 1
   - Link them to the Epic issue
   - Assign story points or time estimates

5. **Set up Milestones**
