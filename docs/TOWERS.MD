# Establishing Signal Authority: Tower Trust System™

![Signal effects](signal-effects.png)

## 1. Tower Source Type

* Static Infrastructure: Old, powerful, and potentially compromised

* Field Tower (deployed by you): Low range, high trust

* Civilian Relay: Long range, but who else is listening?

* Mobile Drone Node: Great flexibility, but fragile and limited bandwidth

Each has a signal score and a trust score—and your units may respond differently to them.

## 2. Assignment Phase (Pre-Mission)

**You choose:**

* Primary tower for coordination

* Optional backup tower if signal drops

* Who believes in which tower

**For example:**

* Vasquez only accepts orders through drone relays ("I don’t trust the static grid")

* Harrison prefers legacy infrastructure ("We used this node in '32. It never failed.")

Already, your pre-mission loadout screen has psychological weight.

## 3. Mid-Mission Doubt (Tower Spoofing Events)

**Let’s say Signal Tower A begins relaying strange pings:**

* “Change objective: Secure grid E-7.”

* “Do not engage. Units are civilians.”

**And Harrison says:**
"Sir… I received a signal from Tower A. It didn’t sound like you."

Do you trust the tower?</br>
Do you switch to your drone relay?</br>
Do you let your section leads decide—and risk divergence?</br>

## 4. Tower Conflict Outcomes

* Unity Bonus: All units follow one tower = strong cohesion

* Split Trust: Units interpret orders differently, leading to delays or improvisation

* Spoofed Tower Chaos: One team acts on false intel. One hesitates. One breaks protocol and exposes your op
