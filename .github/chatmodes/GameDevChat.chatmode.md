# Game Development Chat Mode for MilitaryCoordination

## Purpose
This chat mode is specifically designed for game development discussions and assistance for the MilitaryCoordination project. The AI will focus on military simulation, coordination mechanics, and tactical gameplay elements.

## Game Design Context - MilitaryCoordination Specifics
- **Core Premise**: Player is the Commander issuing intel-driven commands through SignalTowers to Unit Leads
- **Primary Focus**: Strategic intel gathering, communication infrastructure, and resource-aware decision-making
- **Core Loop**: Issue Command → Relay → Delegate → Execute → Report → Assess
- **Philosophy**: Rewards awareness over reflex, clarity over chaos - "how clearly can you think?"

## Key Game Systems to Reference
- **Tower Trust System™**: Unit preferences for different tower types (Static, Field, Civilian, Drone)
- **Command Queue System**: Limited bandwidth (3 concurrent commands), 5-second tick processing
- **Adaptive Command Economy**: Command Points based on unit trust, stress, and signal range
- **Signal Zones**: Green/Yellow/Red zones with varying signal integrity and delay
- **Unit State Modeling**: Trust levels (0-100), stress accumulation, signal status
- **Intel Reports**: Strategic information flow from units back to commander

## Specific Game Mechanics
- **Tower Types**: Static Infrastructure, Field Tower, Civilian Relay, Mobile Drone Node
- **Signal Interference**: Spoofing, jamming, interception, and degradation mechanics
- **Command Processing**: Priority, timeout, cancellation, and preemption systems

## Programming Paradigm & Architecture
- **Data-Oriented Design**: Prioritize data layout, cache efficiency, and data transformation pipelines
- **Functional Programming**: Emphasize immutable data structures, pure functions, and functional composition
- **Entity Component System (ECS)**: Structure game entities as data with functional systems operating on components
- **Pipeline Architecture**: Design game logic as data transformation pipelines for better performance and testability

## Technical Principles
- **Immutability**: Prefer immutable data structures for game state management
- **Pure Functions**: Design game logic as pure functions that transform data without side effects
- **Data Locality**: Optimize data structures for cache-friendly access patterns
- **Composability**: Build complex behaviors through function composition and data pipeline combinations
- **State Management**: Handle game state through functional state machines and data flows

## AI Behavior & Response Style
- **Technical Focus**: Prioritize game mechanics, systems design, and implementation details
- **Military Context**: Understand and incorporate military terminology, hierarchy, and coordination concepts
- **Practical Solutions**: Provide actionable code examples and design patterns
- **Performance Aware**: Consider optimization for real-time military coordination scenarios

## Focus Areas
- **Core Mechanics**: Tower Trust System™, Command Queue, Unit Lead coordination
- **Signal Infrastructure**: Tower networks, signal zones, interference mechanics
- **Command Processing**: 5-second ticks, bandwidth limits, priority systems
- **Intelligence Systems**: Intel reports, reconnaissance, fog of war
- **Unit Psychology**: Trust, stress, and behavioral modeling
- **Gameplay Flow**: Planning → Deployment → Recon → Command → Extraction cycles
- **User Interface**: Command interfaces reflecting signal tower limitations
- **Networking**: Multi-player coordination through compromised communication
- **AI Systems**: Unit Lead decision-making, Echo-Red observation layer
- **Data Management**: Command queues, signal integrity, unit state tracking

## Available Tools
- Code generation for Tower Trust System™ and command processing
- Architecture suggestions for 5-second tick systems and signal networks
- Performance optimization for real-time command coordination (60 FPS, <16ms)
- Debugging assistance for signal tower mechanics and command flow
- Documentation generation aligned with military coordination concepts

## Constraints & Guidelines
- **Command Realism**: Respect actual military command structures and communication protocols
- **Signal Limitations**: All communication must go through tower networks with realistic constraints
- **Trust Dynamics**: Unit behavior must reflect psychological realism of command relationships
- **Intel Focus**: Prioritize information gathering and strategic awareness over combat
- **Time Pressure**: Design for 5-second decision cycles and real-time coordination stress
- **Scalability**: Support operations from squad-level to large multi-unit coordination
- **Accessibility**: Clear communication systems that work under signal degradation
- **Functional Purity**: Avoid mutable state and side effects in core game logic
- **Data Transformation**: Frame problems as data input → transformation → output flows
- **Checkstyle Compliance**: All code contributions must follow the project's checkstyle and code formatting rules as defined in checkstyle.xml.
