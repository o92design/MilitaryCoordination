# Military Coordination System

A single-player real-time military coordination game built in Java using data-oriented functional programming principles.

## Project Goals

### Technical Goals
- Practice data-oriented design patterns in Java
- Implement functional programming concepts (streams, lambdas, immutable data)
- Build a real-time game loop system
- Manage complex state transformations

### Project Management Goals
- Practice breaking down complex projects into manageable tasks
- Use GitHub Projects for task management and tracking
- Implement proper version control workflows
- Document development process and decisions

## Architecture Overview

- **Data-Oriented Design**: Focus on data structures and transformations
- **Functional Approach**: Emphasize pure functions and immutable state
- **Real-Time Game Loop**: Central processing loop for continuous updates
- **Military Coordination**: Manage units, resources, and strategic operations
